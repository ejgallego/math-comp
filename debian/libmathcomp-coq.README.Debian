Ssreflect for Debian
====================

This package doesn't provide the ssrcoq binary as built originally by
upstream (but relies on dynamic linking instead), nor the PDF
documentation (which is available online, see README).

You can use Ssreflect directly with the regular Coq tools. For
compatibility, a symlink to coqtop named "ssrcoq" is provided.

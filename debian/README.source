Ssreflect Debian source package
===============================

Packaging a new upstream
------------------------

 * Ssreflect uses internal structures of Coq and is quite easily
   broken by new versions of Coq. However, some Coq developers
   maintain a working version as Coq development goes at the
   coq-contrib project on INRIA's GForge [1] (in Saclay directory).

Patching upstream sources
-------------------------

This source package uses quilt to apply and remove its patches. Please
refer to `/usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source' for information about
how to use quilt for source packages.

The quilt series is generated from the Git repository, using
dom-{apply,save}-patches, from the dh-ocaml (>= 0.5) package. Please
refer to the appendix about Git in the Debian OCaml Packaging Policy
(from the same package).


Building arch:all package
-------------------------

Building the arch:all package, libssreflect-coq, is not supported on
architectures with native compiler, but with no natdynlink (only armel
at the time of writing).
